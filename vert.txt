Using maya.cmds

maya_cmds_circle = cmds.circle()[0]
cmds.setAttr(maya_cmds_circle + ".overrideEnabled", 1)
cmds.setAttr(maya_cmds_circle + ".overrideColor", 13)
Using PyMel:

pymel_circle = pm.circle()[0]
pymel_circle.overrideEnabled.set(True)
pymel_circle.overrideColor.set(13)
Hope this helps!

EDIT: I'll add some of the common colors as well, Red: 13, Green: 14, Blue: 6, Yellow: 18, the rest you can find by either just testing or scrolling through the override color area in the attribute editor.
